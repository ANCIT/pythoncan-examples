## Expectation
To check the speed status of the engine by accelerator and brake according to the surrounding environment  
## Functionality
The Engine Control system used here is to check the speed status of the engine according to the surrounding environment depending on the signals received. Accelerator and break will be sending messages to engine, where the former will increase the speed of the engine and the latter will reduce the speed of the engine.

## Test Case
1.Initially engine will be off and it is turned on by cranking the engine. By turning on, it will be able to receive signals from accelerator and break.  

2.By pressing key 'b' ,engine will be accelerated to 10kmph.  

3.By pressing key 'c' ,engine will be accelerated to 20kmph.  

4.By pressing key 'd' ,break is applied and engine speed will be 0kmph.
