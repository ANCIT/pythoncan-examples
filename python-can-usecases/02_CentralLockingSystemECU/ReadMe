Central locking system (CLS): Lock, unlock, comfort lock which locks the car and closes the windows.
If a crash occurs then the CLS unlocks the car. The window lift supports opening and closing functions
Functionalities adhere to the comfort.dbc files, consisting of messages and signals that are mapped.

Use cases have been implemented. 
Programs with .can files supports cannoe configuration.
Block diagram attached for precise understanding.

************************************* Socketcan Quickstart *******************************************************

1: The CAN network driver provides a generic interface to setup, configure and monitor CAN devices. 

2: The virtual CAN driver (vcan) --> The virtual CAN interfaces allow the transmission and reception 
	of CAN frames without real CAN controller hardware. 

3: Virtual CAN network devices are usually named vcan0 vcan1 vcan2.

4: To create a virtual can interface using socketcan run the following:

>>> sudo modprobe vcan

>>> sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan	# Create a vcan network interface with a specific name 

>>> sudo ip link set vcan0 up

>>> candump vcan0							# Allows you to print all data that is being received by a CAN interface
