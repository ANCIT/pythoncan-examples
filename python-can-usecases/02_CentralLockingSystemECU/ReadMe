*********** Socketcan Quickstart ************

1: The CAN network driver provides a generic interface to setup, configure and monitor CAN devices. 

2: The virtual CAN driver (vcan) --> The virtual CAN interfaces allow the transmission and reception of CAN frames without real CAN controller hardware. 

3: Virtual CAN network devices are usually named ‘vcanX’, like vcan0 vcan1 vcan2.

4: To create a virtual can interface using socketcan run the following:

>>> sudo modprobe vcan

>>> sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan		# Create a vcan network interface with a specific name and enter password, if required.

>>> sudo ip link set vcan0 up

>>> candump vcan0								# To receive the data
